Given the heads of two linked lists `a` and `b`, return the node at which the two lists intersect.

If there is no intersection, return `None`

The node of intersect is defined as the first node which exists in _both_ lists.

**Input:** `a = [4,1,8,4,5]` and `b = [5,6,1,8,4,5]`

**Output:** `8`

**Why?** The node 8 is the first node shared by both list `a` and `b` (the node of intersect)

# Example 2

**Input:** `a = [2,6,4]` and `b = [1,5]`

**Output:** `None`

**Why** Lists `a` and `b` do not intersect
